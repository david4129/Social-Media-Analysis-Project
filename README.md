# Social Media Analysis Project
## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing social media data to gain insights, identify trends, and provide valuable recommendations. The data originates from multiple social media platforms, including Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and LinkedIn. The primary goal is to leverage data analysis and visualization techniques to uncover actionable insights for our client.
## Project Objectives
The main objective of this project is to generate insights from the given data. To achieve this, we follow a structured methodology that includes the following steps:
1. **Data Familiarization:** Explore the dataset, including columns, data types, and missing values. Gain an understanding of the context of the data from different social media platforms.
2. **Data Cleaning and Pre-processing:** Missing values were filled using nlp and machine learning techniques, data types of features were converted, and duplicate entries were removed.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualization tools were utilized to understand data distribution, trends, and patterns. Identify key metrics, engagement rates, and user demographics.
4. **Feature Engineering:** New Features were added based on our EDA.
5. **Statistical Analysis:** We applied statistical tests and models to identify trends and relationships.
6. **Visualization:** Generate visualizations using tools like Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Streamlit were created to help convey insights gotten from this data.
7. **Reporting:** Findings, insights were compiled into our report. You can check Report.py to see our analysis, visualisations and insights.
